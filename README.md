### Installation my Theme ###

* You should have a Chrome folder here (If not, create it)
* copy everything from the downloaded archive and paste it here
     
     _as a result, you should have a userChrome.css file and a content folder in the chrome folder (depending on the version, besides these two, there may be other files, but these two are required and necessary for correct work)_
